## Introduction
As a Business Intelligence (BI) expert, I recently embarked on an exciting project to revolutionize the way StyleScape Fashion Mall analyzes and utilizes their sales data. Leveraging Power BI, the goal was to create an automated sales dashboard that would enhance operational efficiency, improve business decision-making, and provide a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators crucial to retail success. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project, its insights, and the recommendations derived from the analysis.

## Project Overview
StyleScape Fashion Mall relies heavily on weekly sales performance data to gauge market traction and devise future strategies. The Regional Sales Manager of the Nigerian division faced challenges in obtaining a clear and efficient view of these sales figures. Our solution aimed to address these challenges by enabling quick identification of trends, reducing manual reporting, and facilitating strategic decisions.

Ensure sufficient stock of top-selling items, especially women's shoes and dresses, as well as men's shoes and suits. Analyze customer preferences and adjust inventory levels accordingly to meet demand and minimize stockouts.
